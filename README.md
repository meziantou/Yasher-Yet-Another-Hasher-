Compute hash of files or text.

1. Drag your file to Yasher to start computing.
2. See progress during hash computing.
3. Cancel hash computing in progress without loosing previous computed hash values.
4. Choose one or multiple algorithms between the following:

- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
- RIPEMD160

5. Shows hashes in hexadecimal and base 64.

At start, algorithms selected for last computed hash are ticked by default.
Compare 2 files easily: previous and current hashes are colored in green if identical, in red otherwise.
This program is multithreaded to optimize computing speed when multiple algorithms are selected.
